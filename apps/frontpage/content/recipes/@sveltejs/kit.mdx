<Callout variant="neutral" icon="‚ÑπÔ∏è" title="Prerequisites">

This recipe assumes that you already have a **SvelteKit >= 1.0** app and have just set up **Storybook >= 7.0** using the [getting started guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/install?renderer=svelte). Don't have this? Follow Sveltekit's [setup instructions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project) then run:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npm create storybook@latest
```

</Callout>

## Feature support

With our package, Storybook automatically mirrors the project settings of SvelteKit. Here's what you'll get:

- üìö Supports imports that use the special `$lib` alias
- üëì Components can read current environment information from `$app/environment`
- üñºÔ∏è `$app/paths` is supported so you can safely get paths for assets
- üõí Stores in `$app/stores` are supported out of the box

## In a project without Storybook

Run the following command in your SvelteKit project's root directory, and follow the prompts:

```shell
npm create storybook@latest
```

Storybook will automatically detect your SvelteKit project and install the necessary packages and configurations.

## In a project with Storybook

If you‚Äôre already using Storybook prior to version 7 in a project, upgrade Storybook with this command, and follow the prompts:

```shell
npx storybook@latest upgrade
```

If your existing project is configured with the Vite builder, it will prompt you to migrate your Storybook configuration and dependencies to the new `@storybook/sveltekit` package automatically.

If your existing Storybook setup is using the Webpack builder, it can‚Äôt automatically migrate for you, because there‚Äôs no way to migrate your Webpack configuration to a Vite configuration. In that case, follow the [manual migration steps](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/sveltekit?renderer=svelte#manual-migration) instead.

## Get involved

Now you're ready to use SvelteKit with Storybook. üéâ If you use SvelteKit at work, we'd love your feedback on the SvelteKit + Storybook experience.
