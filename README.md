Welcome to the new home for Storybook's main website and documentation. It is mainly built around Next.js, Tailwind, Turborepo and obviously Storybook ✌️

## Monorepo

This project is structured around [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo). This doesn't include all projects just yet but we are importing all the pieces together slowly. Here are the main components of it:

- `apps/frontpage` - Main website + Docs
- `packages/utils` - Any functions useful across apps
- `packages/ui` - Component library across apps

## Main commands

#### `npm install`

> Install all dependencies

#### `npx turbo fetch-docs`

> Fetch docs from the monorepo

#### `npx turbo generate-redirects`

> Generate redirects file

#### `npx turbo dev`

> Run all apps locally

#### `npx turbo build`

> Build all apps locally

#### `npm run clean`

> Clean the monorepo. You'll have to install dependencies again after running this command with `npm install`
